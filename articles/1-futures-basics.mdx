# The Basics: From Handshakes to a Global Marketplace

### What is a Forward Contract?

A forward is an agreement to buy or sell something (an asset) for a certain price at a certain date in the future.

Imagine you are interested in sneaker reselling. You recently noticed that Nike released the Jordan 4 Military Black colorway, currently priced at 350 dollars on the reselling market. You believe the shoes are undervalued and that exactly one year from now, they’re going to be more scarce and their value will go up. So, you approach a reseller and tell him, “I will buy these shoes for 400 dollars exactly a year from now.” He agrees because he thinks the price will go down from Nike re-releasing them many times, and you guys shake hands.

That’s a forward contract.

### The Problem with Handshakes: Counterparty Risk

However, you may ask, “If this is a verbal agreement, what stops me from simply backing out?”

The answer is nothing, and that’s where futures contracts come in.

### Introducing Futures: Standardized & Secure

Futures contracts are exchange-mediated forward contracts, where exchanges ensure that both the buyers and sellers of the contracts go through on their deal. They do this by having clearinghouses act as middlemen in deals (you don’t know who’s on the other side of the trade because you’re trading with the clearinghouse and they deal with the rest). Both buyers and sellers put down initial margin (upfront money) to open a trade and settle profits and losses at the end of each day. This is done by asking either side to put up maintenance margin (to show they have the money to cover any losses) to allow the trade to remain open.

If losses get too large for either side of the deal at the end of a day, they receive a margin call, meaning they must add more margin to the account or the trade is closed. This prevents large amounts of debt from building up on one side of the deal. This all happens behind the scenes; all you see is money coming in and out of your account depending on profits and losses.

You might then ask, “What if one side gets a large margin call and doesn’t pay? Do I lose money?” The answer is the clearinghouse pays this debt with its funds to ensure every trade is guaranteed. The clearinghouse then deals with collecting the unpaid debt in a similar way a bank does (sues, seizes assets, etc.).

Going back to the sneaker reselling example: Imagine over the span of the year, Nike re-releases the military blacks 10 times and now everyone has them. The resell price has plummeted to 300 dollars. However, you agreed to buy them for 400 dollars, meaning on paper, you have a 100 dollar loss. This is a large risk of futures contracts, since both sides are obligated to go through on their deal and they don’t have the option to back out.
