# Understanding Your Option's Position (OTM, ATM, ITM)

The type of an option is determined by the relationship between its strike price and the current price of the underlying stock. This relationship decides whether an option has any real, concrete value right now, or if its value is purely based on future potential.

## Intrinsic vs. Extrinsic Value: An Option's Two Halves

An option's premium is made of two components:

- **Intrinsic Value:** This is the option's value if it were exercised immediately. For a call option, it's calculated as Stock Price - Strike Price. Intrinsic value can never be negative; if the result is negative, the intrinsic value is simply zero.
- **Extrinsic Value (or Time Value):** This is the value based on the potential for the option to gain more intrinsic value in the future. It's influenced by time until expiration and volatility.

These concepts are key to understanding the three "moneyness" states of an option.

## Out of the Money (OTM)

An Out of the Money (OTM) option is one where the strike price has not yet been reached. For a call option, this means the stock price is less than the strike price.

You can think of it as a riskier bet on your prediction. For example, if you think a 100 dollar stock will go to \$150, you might buy a 120 dollar strike call option for a 2 dollar premium. To start making money, the stock has to rise to your breakeven price of $122 (120 dollar strike + 2 dollar premium) by expiration.

The main appeal of OTM options is that their premiums are much lower. This lower upfront cost means you can buy a larger number of contracts. OTM options are made up entirely of extrinsic value â†’ they have no concrete current value, only future potential. If an option is still OTM at expiration, its extrinsic value disappears, and it expires worthless (\$0).

## At the Money (ATM)

An At the Money (ATM) option has a strike price that is essentially equal to the current stock price.

For example, if you think a 100 dollar stock will go to \$150, you could buy a 100 dollar strike option with a 10 dollar premium. Your breakeven price would be \$110. Notice the premium is much higher than the OTM example; if you only had \$10, you could buy one ATM contract versus five of the OTM contracts.

Since the stock price equals the strike price (\$100 - \$100 = \$0), ATM options have no intrinsic value. However, they typically have the highest extrinsic value because they are at the point of maximum uncertainty, with the greatest potential to move into the money.

## In the Money (ITM)

An In the Money (ITM) option is one that already has intrinsic value. For a call option, this means the stock price is greater than the strike price.

It's like paying for a head start or better insurance in case the price moves against you. For example, if you think a 100 dollar stock will go to \$150, you could buy an 80 dollar strike option. If the premium is \$22, your contract already has \$20 of intrinsic value (100 dollar stock price - 80 dollar strike). The premium for ITM options is the most expensive because you are paying for that existing intrinsic value plus some remaining extrinsic value.

Overall, the goal is for any option you buy to end up ITM so it can be sold for a profit. OTM options offer higher leverage for a lower premium, while ITM options are more conservative but require more capital upfront.

A put option's graph is the same, except you swap the "In the money" and "Out of the money" arrows, since prices below the strike (to the left) are in the money for puts, and prices above the strike (to the right) are out of the money for puts.

Now that we understand how an option is classified, we can ask: how are these premium numbers universally determined? That is where the Black-Scholes Formula comes in.
