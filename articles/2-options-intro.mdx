# The Power of Choice: An Introduction to Options

### Limiting Your Risk: The Right, Not the Obligation

That’s where options come in. It’s similar to a futures contract (agreeing to buy/sell something at a future date for a predetermined price), except you pay a premium (an upfront cost) for the right, but not the obligation, to go through on your deal. If the price of the Jordan 4s went to \$300 (against you), you are allowed to back out of the deal and only lose the premium you paid at the start.

### Betting on a Rise: Call Options

And if the price went all the way up to \$600, you can use your contract to buy the pair for \$400 and instantly sell them for the current 600 dollar price to make \$200. This is called a call option.

### Betting on a Fall: Put Options

What about if you want to bet on the price of an asset to go down? You can do so by shorting, which can be imagined like this: a big bank owns 100 shares of Tesla stock. You think Tesla is overpriced with a current price of \$400 a share, so you make an agreement to borrow 1 share of Tesla from the bank and sell it to someone instantly to get \$400 in cash. However, you now owe the bank a share of Tesla. Over the weekend, Elon Musk tweets that Tesla is overpriced and that he is shorting his own company. The stock plummets 40 percent to \$240. You now buy back that stock for \$240 and return the share to the bank you borrowed from. The bank still owns 100 shares of Tesla, except now you own `400 - 240 = 160` in cash.

Now imagine instead, Elon Musk didn’t tweet anything and Tesla released a statement that they are now receiving \$100 billion of government funding. The stock surges 75 percent to \$700. You now have to buy Tesla stock for \$700 to give the bank their share back, and since you originally got \$400, you have a `400 - 700 = -300` loss. This is why people say shorting is extremely risky. Imagine you were even more excited and instead of borrowing 1 share, you borrowed 10 shares for \$4000. Now you have to buy 10 shares back for a total of \$7000, meaning you lose \$3000. This loss is technically unlimited because while a stock can only lose 100 percent of its value, it can gain an unlimited amount.

So how can you bet on a stock losing value while not risking multi-generational debt? That’s where put options come in. You are buying a contract. For example: Apple stock is at \$150. You buy a put contract that says “I have the right to sell 1 share of Apple for \$150 exactly 1 year from now.” You hold this contract for 364 days and become depressed as Apple stock climbs to \$170. However, in the final day, Apple releases their earnings report which disappoints investors, and the stock retraces to \$120. You can now buy the stock for the current price of \$120 and immediately use your contract to sell it for \$150, making a 30 dollar profit. If Apple's earnings instead went better than expected and your contract expires with Apple stock at \$170, do you owe \$20? No. Since this is a put option, all you lose is the premium you paid at the start.

The premium of a contract can be thought of as the price you pay to have the choice to back out when things go south and go through on the deal when it goes your way. Since you’re paying a premium, or a sort of “fee,” to buy put or call options, the worst case is you just lose that premium.

For example, if you think Nvidia is overpriced at \$1100 and will fall to \$700, you buy a put option. The stock doubles overnight to \$2200, but all you lose is the small premium you paid. Now you *definitely* think Nvidia is overpriced, so you buy another put with a strike price of \$1100 for a 2 dollar premium. This time, Nvidia falls to \$600. Your put lets you sell at the 1100 dollar strike, so you profit the difference: `1100 (strike) - 600 (current price) - 2 (premium) = 498` per share. You take your winnings and buy more puts because you think you've found an infinite money glitch.


### Key Terminology

When someone refers to the **underlying** in an option, they're simply talking about the asset that the option is being traded on. For example, if I buy a call on Apple, then Apple is the underlying asset.  

Options also have something called a **strike price**, which is the price at which you can buy (for calls) or sell (for puts) the asset.  

And finally, every contract has an **expiration date**. This is the last day your option is valid. If your prediction doesn't play out by this date, the contract becomes worthless, and you only lose the premium you paid.  

For example:  
I buy a call option on Nvidia, whose price is currently \$1000, with a strike price of \$1100 expiring in a year for a premium of \$30. If Nvidia goes to \$1200, I profit:  


1200 (current price) - 1100 (strike) - 30 (premium) = 70
Why shouldn’t I just buy a call option with a strike at the initial stock price of \$1000? My profit would be:

1200 - 1000 - 30 = 170
This is because the premium would not have been \$30; it would be more like \$60, and there would’ve been a trade-off with how many contracts you could afford versus their potential profits.

Now that we've got the key terms down, let's look at where your option stands relative to the market price. Is it in the money, at the money, or out of the money?
