# My Role on Project Alpha

This is the story of Project Alpha. I was responsible for designing and implementing the core trading logic using Python, focusing on minimizing latency.

### Key Features Implemented:
- Real-time data processing from multiple exchange APIs.
- A low-latency execution engine built with asynchronous libraries.
- A comprehensive backtesting suite to validate strategy performance.

This project was a deep dive into the mechanics of high-frequency systems.
